For example, the term Romanization of Japanese is used to describe the process of using the Latin alphabet to transliterate the Japanese language.\nIn the Romanization of Japanese, the Hepburn system is the most common form of writing Japanese using the Latin alphabet, as opposed to the Kunrei-shiki system and the Nihon-shiki system.\nThe process of Romanization has been applied to a number of languages. The process of writing Japanese in the Latin alphabet, for example, is called Romanization of Japanese.\nRomanization can be used for various purposes. For example, it is often used for technical reasons: to write a language that uses another alphabet, or to facilitate a search in a database. It can also be used to make a language easier to learn, to give it a more modern look, or to integrate it into another language.\nThe process of Romanization can be used to convert a text from one language to another. For example, the Japanese word “kanji” can be written in the Latin alphabet as “kanji” or “kana”, depending on the context. The process of Romanization can also be used to convert a text from one language to another. For example, the Japanese word “kanji” can be written in the Latin alphabet as “kanji” or “kana”, depending on the context.\nRomanization is also used to write the names of languages in the Latin alphabet. For example, the Japanese language is written as “Nihongo” in the Latin alphabet, while the Chinese language is written as “Chine” in the Latin alphabet.\nRomanization is used to write the names of languages in the Latin alphabet.

In 911, Louis was still a minor, but was now old enough to sign a treaty with the Vikings. The treaty was for a price of 7,000 livres of silver.

It has changed the way companies are governed, and is now being adopted in other countries around the world. It has also had a significant impact on the way accountants do their jobs, and it has even had an effect on the way we do business with our customers. This is a new era of compliance, and it's time to take a look at how it has changed the way we do business.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2002. It was a response to the accounting scandals that rocked the world of business in the late 1990s. The biggest of these scandals was the collapse of Enron, a company that had been one of the most profitable and successful companies in the world. The collapse of Enron led to the loss of over 40,000 jobs and the loss of billions of dollars of shareholder value.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act was designed to prevent similar scandals from happening in the future. It required companies to have better internal controls and to be more transparent in their financial reporting. It also required that the audit committee of the board of directors have at least one member who was a financial expert. The Act also required that companies have an internal audit function and that the audit committee of the board of directors be responsible for the selection of the auditor.\nThe Act has had a significant impact on the way businesses are governed. It has changed the way boards of directors are selected, and it has changed the way companies are audited. It has also had a significant impact on the way accountants do their jobs. The Act has made it more difficult to do business with companies that are not in compliance with the law. It has also made it more difficult to get information about companies that are not in compliance.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act is one of the most important pieces of legislation affecting business in the last 20 years.

That was a very big deal, and it was the last time the Turks tried to make a major push into Europe. I believe it was a turning point for the Turks. The Ottoman empire started to decline after that, and the Austrians became a major power in Europe. They had a long border with the Turks, so it was a major threat to them. The French were not involved in the siege of Vienna, and they were not involved in the war that followed.

    "input": "Who made Robert of Jumieges earl of Hereford?",
    "output": "Who made Robert of Jumieges earl of Hereford?php <p class=”p1”>The answer is, no one knows. At least not definitively. Robert of Jumieges, or Jumiéges, was an Anglo-Saxon monk and churchman who served as archbishop of Canterbury and chancellor to King Edward the Confessor. He was also a major landholder, and his lands were divided between his two brothers, Bishop Odo of Bayeux and Bishop Herbrand of Thérouanne. His brother Odo was granted the earldom of Kent, and Robert’s was Herefordshire. The problem is, there’s no record of Robert ever being granted the earldom, and Herefordshire had already been given to his brother-in-law, Ealdred of Bamborough. The answer is probably that Ealdred died before he took up the title, and Robert was given it in his place. But there’s no contemporary record of this, and it’s not even clear that Robert was even in England when he was supposed to be earl. So who was Robert of Jumieges? He was the son of a Norman nobleman, and he was the brother of Odo of Bayeux, who was the brother-in-law of Edward the Confessor.

    "output": "Who made Edward the Confessor Earl?php the date('Y')?\nI'm working on a project on the origins of the Norman Conquest and I have been looking at the background to the Norman claim to the throne. One of the arguments made by William is that Harold had no right to the throne because Edward had named him as his successor. This is the source for that claim:\n\"Edward, the Confessor, son of Æthelred and brother of Harold, gave him (William) the kingdom of England in his will, in which he said, 'I have made my will that William, Duke of the Normans, should have the government of England.'\"\nThis is from the William of Malmesbury, Gesta regum Anglorum. But I'm having trouble finding a reference to this in any other sources. I would like to know if anyone knows of any other sources that refer to this.\nposted by: David at 9:35 AM\nThe date is wrong, as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says that Edward died on 5th October 1066.\nI am not sure that William of Malmesbury is the best source for this. The story is that Edward made William his heir, and then Harold was made his heir, and then Edward died and Harold was made king. It is not clear from William of Malmesbury if Edward was aware of this. It is clear that Edward made Harold his heir, but I am not sure if William of Malmesbury is claiming that Edward was aware of Harold's actions. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says that Harold was made heir on Edward's deathbed, and that Edward was not aware of this.\nThere are other sources that mention the succession, but I don't think any of them say that Edward made William his heir.\nposted by: David at 9:40 AM\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is the most important source for the succession, but it is not the only source. The Bayeux Tapestry shows Harold being crowned king, which is not mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, but it does say that Edward named Harold as his heir, and that Edward was not aware of Harold's actions.\nposted by: David at 9:45 AM\nThe Bayeux Tapestry is not a source, it is an interpretation of the events by the Normans. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is a source. It is not clear if the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is a source for Edward naming Harold his heir, or Harold naming himself his heir. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is a source for Harold being crowned King, but it is not a source for Harold being named his heir.\nposted by: David at 9:50 AM\nI don't know if Edward named William his heir. There are a number of reasons for William to claim this. The most important is that Edward was childless, and William was the only person with a claim. It is possible that Edward named Harold his heir, but it is not certain. Harold was Edward's brother, but Edward was the son of Edward's elder brother. The other possibility is that Harold was named his heir by the Witan. The Witan was the council of advisors, and they had the power to name the king. Harold was the most powerful member of the Witan, so it is likely that they named him as king.\nposted by: David at 9:55 AM\nI am not sure if Edward named William his heir.

If P=NP, then it is possible to find the maximum flow in polynomial time, and in particular in linear time.\nThe problem of finding the maximum flow in a network is a very important problem. In particular, it is a problem that is solved by many compilers of routing tables in the Internet.\nThe problem of finding the maximum flow in a network is the problem of finding the maximum number of paths in a network. The maximum number of paths is the maximum number of paths that go from a source to a sink, subject to the condition that the flow in each path is equal to one.\nThere is a problem of finding the maximum number of paths in a network, which is the problem of finding the maximum number of paths in a network, subject to the condition that the flow in each path is equal to one.

What does computational simplicity theory most specifically seek to answer?_\nasked Jan 29, 2012 by anonymous1\nThe answer is \"nothing\". It's not a field of mathematics. It's a name given to a particular approach to the question \"How can we prove that problems are hard?\" The approach is to find problems that are \"easier\" than the problems you are trying to prove hard, and show that the easier problems are hard. The problems are easier in the sense that they are easier to state, and easier to prove.\nanswered Jan 29, 2012 by S. S. C. ( 5,280 points)\nI am a bit rusty, but as I understand it, the idea is to find a problem which is hard to solve but easy to verify. That is, the problem is to find a problem such that if you are given the answer, you can verify that the answer is correct in polynomial time, but it is not known if it is possible to solve the problem in polynomial time.\nanswered Jan 29, 2012 by anonymous2\nIt's the study of what is and what is not a problem that is \"easy\" or \"hard\" to compute. The idea is that we can't just say a problem is hard, we need to be able to prove that it's hard. In order to prove that a problem is hard, we need to be able to find some other problem that is \"easier\" to compute and we can prove is hard."

The symbols are the letters of the Greek alphabet. The number of symbols is the number of letters in the alphabet. So a string of length 3 over the Greek alphabet is a string of 3 Greek letters.\nIn the same way, a string of length 3 over the English alphabet is a string of 3 English letters.\nA string of length 3 over the alphabet $\\{0,1\\}$ is a string of length 3 consisting of the symbols 0 and 1.\n$\\begingroup$ So the number of strings of length 3 over the alphabet $\\{0,1\\}$ is $2^3$? $\\endgroup$ –  user Aug 8 '16 at 5:51\n$\\begingroup$ Yes. More generally, the number of strings of length $n$ over the alphabet $\\Sigma$ is $|\\Sigma|^n$. $\\endgroup$ –  Yuval Filmus Aug 8 '16 at 5:52\n$\\begingroup$ If the alphabet is $\\Sigma = \\{0,1\\}$, then $|\\Sigma| = 2$. $\\endgroup$ –  Yuval Filmus Aug 8 '16 at 5:53\n$\\begingroup$ Thanks.

A number can be represented as a decimal or a binary number. A vector can be represented as a list of numbers or as a matrix. A set can be represented as a list of elements or as a table of rows and columns.\n• What is represented by non-binary notation in the encoding of mathematical objects?\n• The encoding of a mathematical object is the representation of the object in a form that can be processed by a computer. The representation is typically expressed in a binary notation, which is a sequence of 0s and 1s. The representation is usually a sequence of bits that can be processed by a computer.\n• What is represented by non-binary notation in the encoding of mathematical objects?\n• Non-binary notation in the encoding of mathematical objects is used to represent mathematical objects that are not binary. For example, a mathematical object that is represented by a non-binary notation is a mathematical object that is not a number."

I have found that the best way to answer this question is to look at the problem and think about how it is solved.\nThe answer is that the complexity of a problem is measured by the amount of time it takes to solve it. The more time it takes, the more complex the problem is. The more time it takes to solve the problem, the more complex the problem is. The more time it takes to solve the problem, the more complex the problem is.\nThe problem of complexity is a bit like a computer game. It’s a game that you play on your computer, and you play it for a long time. You’re playing it for a long time, and you’re playing it for a long time, and you’re playing it for a long time, and you’re playing it for a long time, and you’re playing it for a long time.\nThe problem is that we don’t know how to measure the complexity of a problem.

I have a homework problem which states that the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm is O(n^2) and that the algorithm is called for a set of 100 items. I know that n is the number of items. How do I calculate the time complexity? I know that 100 is a constant, but I'm not sure how to write that in the expression.\n$\\begingroup$ $n$ is the number of items, but in your case it is the number of items in the input. $100$ is a constant. $100^2$ is the worst-case time complexity. $\\endgroup$ –  John May 19 '16 at 21:17\nThe worst-case time complexity is the maximum amount of time the algorithm takes for any input of size n.

I understand that the time complexity is O(n) because the algorithm requires one pass through the array, but how is it O(n log n)? I understand that if you divide a list in half each time you get O(log n), but what case is represented when each pivoting divides the list in thirds?\nalgorithm complexity-theory\nI don't understand what you are asking. Could you clarify? –  Kasper van den Berg Sep 19 '12 at 9:03\nup vote 2 down vote accepted If you divide the list in thirds, then the number of divisions is log_3 n. If each division takes O(n) time, then the total time is O(n log_3 n). Now, log_3 n = log_2 n / log_2 3 = log_2 n / 1.58. So O(n log_3 n) is O(n log_2 n / 1.58) = O(n log_2 n).\nThe reason for the log_3 n divisions is that after each division, you have three sublists, and each sublist is roughly 1/3 of the length of the original list. So to get down to 1 element, you need to divide the list log_3 n times.\nshare | improve this answer edited Nov 6 '12 at 18:04 answered Sep 19 '12 at 9:12\nThanks.

I don't know if I can accept your answer. The reason I don't is that I don't know what the log_3 n divisions is. Is it a formula for finding the number of divisions? –  user1539055 Sep 19 '12 at 9:46\n@user1539055, it is a formula for the number of divisions. –  rrenaud Sep 19 '12 at 9:48"

    "output": "What does a big O notation hide?:// What does a big O notation hide?\nIt is a mathematical way of classifying the growth of a function. It gives us an idea of how the function scales as the input increases. It is a way of saying that a function is bounded by a constant times a function that grows at the given rate. For example, if we have a function f(n) that is O(n) we know that there is a constant c and a function g(n) that is n such that f(n) is always less than or equal to c * g(n). The notation is used to say that f(n) is bounded by a function that grows at the same rate as g(n).\nBig O notation is a way of describing the performance of an algorithm. It is used to classify algorithms based on how their running time or space requirements grow as the size of the input grows. The notation can be used to describe the worst, average, or best case behavior of an algorithm.\nBig O notation is used to describe the worst case behavior of an algorithm. It is the most common way to describe the performance of an algorithm. The notation is used to compare the performance of different algorithms.\nBig O notation is used to describe the average case behavior of an algorithm. It is less common than the worst case notation, but it is still used to compare the performance of different algorithms.\nBig O notation is used to describe the best case behavior of an algorithm. It is the least common way to describe the performance of an algorithm. The notation is used to compare the performance of different algorithms.\nWhat does a big O notation hide?\nThere are several reasons why a big O notation can be used to hide the details of an algorithm. One reason is that it allows the algorithm to be described in a concise and general way. This can be useful when the algorithm is complex and it is difficult to describe it in detail. Another reason is that it allows the algorithm to be compared with other algorithms in a more general way. This can be useful when comparing different algorithms to determine which one is better.\nBig O notation is a way of describing the efficiency of an algorithm. It is used to compare the growth rate of two functions.

Dec 12, 2014. Complexity classes are a classification of problems according to how quickly we can solve them. The most famous complexity classes are P, NP, PSPACE, and EXPTIME, and the relations between them are illustrated by the following picture: This is a very important picture, but there are a lot of things it doesn't cover. This post will try to show some of the things that fit into the picture, and some that don't.\nWhat is the most important problem in theoretical computer science? It’s a question I’ve been thinking about a lot lately. I’ve been thinking about it because I’m writing a paper on the topic, and also because I’m thinking about how to explain what I’m doing to the general public. I think it’s an interesting question, and it’s one that’s been asked a lot in the past, and I think it’s worth exploring."

A problem is NP-hard if every problem in NP reduces to it. To prove a problem is NP-hard, you need to exhibit a polynomial time algorithm that solves every problem in NP using your problem. To do this, you need to find an algorithm that takes a problem instance in NP, and reduces it to an instance of your problem. You can then show that the solution to your problem instance can be used to solve the original problem instance. This is a very useful technique for showing a problem is hard, but it's not always possible to find a reduction from NP-complete problems to your problem. For example, if your problem is in NP, then it is not NP-hard.\nThe second technique is to show that a problem is NP-hard by showing that it is NP-hard to approximate it. This is a powerful technique because it shows that even if the problem is in P, it is not possible to approximate it better than some known approximation. This is a very useful technique for showing a problem is hard, but it's not always possible to show that a problem is NP-hard to approximate. For example, if your problem is in P, then it is not NP-hard to approximate it.\nThe third technique is to show that a problem is NP-hard by showing that it is NP-hard to approximate it with some approximation algorithm. This is a powerful technique because it shows that even if the problem is in P, it is not possible to approximate it better than some known approximation. This is a very useful technique for showing a problem is hard, but it's not always possible to show that a problem is NP-hard to approximate with some approximation algorithm.\nThe fourth technique is to show that a problem is NP-hard by showing that it is NP-hard to approximate it with some approximation algorithm. This is a powerful technique because it shows that even if the problem is in P, it is not possible to approximate it better than some known approximation. This is a very useful technique for showing a problem is hard, but it's not always possible to show that a problem is NP-hard to approximate with some approximation algorithm.\nThe fifth technique is to show that a problem is NP-hard by showing that it is NP-hard to approximate it with some approximation algorithm. This is a powerful technique because it shows that even if the problem is in P, it is not possible to approximate it better than some known approximation. This is a very useful technique for showing a problem is hard, but it's not always possible to show that a problem is NP-hard to approximate with some approximation algorithm.\nThe sixth technique is to show that a problem is NP-hard by showing that it is NP-hard to approximate it with some approximation algorithm. This is a powerful technique because it shows that even if the problem is in P, it is not possible to approximate it better than some known approximation. This is a very useful technique for showing a problem is hard, but it's not always possible to show that a problem is NP-hard to approximate with some approximation algorithm.\nThe seventh technique is to show that a problem is NP-hard by showing that it is NP-hard to approximate it with some approximation algorithm. This is a powerful technique because it shows that even if the problem is in P, it is not possible to approximate it better than some known approximation. This is a very useful technique for showing a problem is hard, but it's not always possible to show that a problem is NP-hard to approximate with some approximation algorithm.\nThe eighth technique is to show that a problem is NP-hard by showing that it is NP-hard to approximate it with some approximation algorithm. This is a powerful technique because it shows that even if the problem is in P, it is not possible to approximate it better than some known approximation. This is a very useful technique for showing a problem is hard, but it's not always possible to show that a problem is NP-hard to approximate with some approximation algorithm.\nThe ninth technique is to show that a problem is NP-hard by showing that it is NP-hard to approximate it with some approximation algorithm. This is a powerful technique because it shows that even if the problem is in P, it is not possible to approximate it better than some known approximation. This is a very useful technique for showing a problem is hard, but it's not always possible to show that a problem is NP-hard to approximate with some approximation algorithm.\nThe tenth technique is to show that a problem is NP-hard by showing that it is NP-hard to approximate it with some approximation algorithm. This is a powerful technique because it shows that even if the problem is in P, it is not possible to approximate it better than some known approximation.

The Clay Mathematics Institute is offering a $1,000,000 prize for the first correct proof of this problem.\nIf it is shown that P is equal to NP, then all NP problems can be solved in polynomial time. This would have a profound effect on the efficiency of all problems in NP.

The question is, \"What is a particular problem in biology that would benefit from determining that P = NP?\" The answer is that it would benefit biology by making it easier to analyze biological data. For example, if P = NP, then it would be much easier to determine the structure of proteins. This is because the problem of finding the structure of a protein can be thought of as a problem of finding the best solution to a particular problem. If P = NP, then there would be a polynomial time algorithm for finding the best solution to this problem.\nWhat is a particular problem in biology that would benefit from determining that P = NP? This is a question that is often asked in the field of computer science. The answer is that there are many problems that would benefit from a proof of P = NP. One example is the problem of finding the shortest path between two points in a network. Another example is the problem of finding the best route for a delivery truck. If P = NP, then there would be a polynomial time algorithm for solving both of these problems.\nWhat is a particular problem in biology that would benefit from determining that P = NP?\nWhat is a particular problem in biology that would benefit from determining that P = NP? The answer is that it would benefit from determining that P = NP because it would allow us to better understand the process of evolution. Evolution is a process that is very important in biology, and it is important to understand how it works in order to better understand how life works.\nWhat is a particular problem in biology that would benefit from determining that P = NP?\nThere is no one answer to this question. However, some examples of problems that would benefit from a proof of P = NP include: -Finding the best way to solve a particular problem -Finding the best way to find a solution to a problem -Finding the best way to find a solution to a problem in a given time frame -Finding the best way to find a solution to a problem in a given time frame and space\nWhat is a particular problem in biology that would benefit from determining that P = NP?\nThe answer is that it would benefit from determining that P = NP because it would help to understand the problem better. For example, if P = NP, then it would be easier to understand the problem of finding the best way to pack items in a container. This is because the problem of finding the best way to pack items in a container can be thought of as a problem of finding the best way to pack items in a container."

Jun 9, 2011\n\n### 0rth\n\nWhat is a particular problem in chemistry that would benefit from determining that P = NP?\n\n2. Jun 9, 2011\n\n### chroot\n\nStaff Emeritus\nI don't know of any. I'm not sure it's possible.\n\n3. Jun 9, 2011\n\n### S.0\n\nWell, I don't think you can prove that P=NP, but I think there's a very good chance that P=NP. In which case, there are a number of problems that can be solved in polynomial time.\n\nThe most obvious one is the knapsack problem.\n\n4. Jun 9, 2011\n\n### Staff: Mentor\n\nI'm pretty sure the answer is that it is not known whether P=NP. In fact, it is not even known whether P≠NP.\n\n5. Jun 9, 2011\n\n### S.0\n\nRight, I was thinking that the answer was that it was not known.\n\n6. Jun 9, 2011\n\n### chroot\n\nStaff Emeritus\nI'm not sure what you're getting at. What's the knapsack problem?\n\n7. Jun 9, 2011\n\n### S.0\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem\n\n8. Jun 9, 2011\n\n### chroot\n\nStaff Emeritus\nI'm not sure how that is any more useful than a brute-force search. It's not a polynomial-time algorithm. It's a pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm.\n\n9. Jun 9, 2011\n\n### S.0\n\nWell, I thought that was the point of the question. If you can find a polynomial time algorithm, then you can prove that P=NP.\n\n10. Jun 9, 2011\n\n### chroot\n\nStaff Emeritus\nIf you can find a polynomial-time algorithm for any problem, you can prove P=NP. If you can find a polynomial-time algorithm for any problem in NP, you can prove P=NP.\n\n11. Jun 9, 2011\n\n### S.0\n\nI don't think I've ever heard of the knapsack problem before. I just googled it, and it seems to be a problem that is a subset of the traveling salesman problem.\n\n12. Jun 9, 2011\n\n### S.0\n\nWell, I think I'm confused. I thought that P was the set of problems that can be solved in polynomial time, and NP was the set of problems that can be solved in non-deterministic polynomial time. Is that not the case?\n\n13. Jun 9, 2011\n\n### chroot\n\nStaff Emeritus\nYes, that's correct. It's not known whether P=NP.\n\n14. Jun 9, 2011\n\n### S.0\n\nOkay, well I thought that was the point of the question. If you can find a polynomial time algorithm for any problem, then you can prove that P=NP.\n\n15. Jun 9, 2011\n\n### chroot\n\nStaff Emeritus\nThat's right. But the knapsack problem is not in P.\n\n16. Jun 9, 2011\n\n### S.0\n\nOkay, I'm sorry. I'm not sure how I'm confused, but I am.\n\n17. Jun 9, 2011\n\n### chroot\n\nStaff Emeritus\nIt's not a polynomial-time algorithm. It's a pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm. There is a difference.\n\n18. Jun 9, 2011\n\n### S.0\n\nAh, I see. So what is the difference?\n\n19. Jun 9, 2011\n\n### chroot\n\nStaff Emeritus\nA polynomial-time algorithm is one which takes time proportional to a polynomial function of the size of the input. A pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm is one which takes time proportional to a polynomial function of the size of the input and some other number.\n\n20. Jun 9, 2011\n\n### S.0\n\nOh, I see. So the knapsack problem is not in P because the size of the input is not the only factor in how long it takes to solve the problem."

    "output": "What is the problem attributed to defining if two finite graphs are isomorphic?://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism#Isomorphism_of_finite_graphs\nA graph isomorphism is a mapping from the nodes of one graph to the nodes of the other graph, such that any two nodes of the first graph are adjacent if and only if their images in the second graph are adjacent.\nIsomorphism of finite graphs is an example of a problem which is believed to be decidable, but for which no practical algorithm is known. The graph isomorphism problem is the problem of determining for some input, given two graphs G and H, whether they are isomorphic.\nWhat is the problem with this problem? What are the practical applications of graph isomorphism? If it is so important, why can't we find a practical algorithm?\n$\\begingroup$ The problem is that we don't know the answer. It is believed that there is no efficient algorithm. $\\endgroup$ –  Thomas Andrews Sep 24 '15 at 12:52\n$\\begingroup$ This question is about graph isomorphism. $\\endgroup$ –  Thomas Andrews Sep 24 '15 at 12:53\n$\\begingroup$ I think the question is fine.

The problem is, I think, that it is not clear what you mean by \"practical\". It is easy to decide whether a graph isomorphism problem is a problem, and it is easy to decide whether a graph isomorphism problem is a problem.

But it is very hard to decide whether it is a practical problem. And the answer to that question is a lot more complicated than the answer to whether it is a problem.\nFor example, it is easy to find a graph isomorphism algorithm that is efficient, if the graphs are not too large. It is easy to find a graph isomorphism algorithm that is efficient, if the graphs are very large, but you have a lot of information about them.\nSo, there is no single algorithm, but there are many algorithms, depending on what you know about the problem.\nFor example, it is easy to find an efficient algorithm to decide whether two trees are isomorphic. If you know that the graphs are trees, then you can use that algorithm.\nThe graph isomorphism problem is the problem of determining for some input, given two graphs $G$ and $H$, whether they are isomorphic.\nThis is not a well-defined problem. It is easy to determine that two graphs are not isomorphic, but there is no algorithm that will tell you that two graphs are isomorphic, except in the case that you can see that they are isomorphic.\nThe problem is that we don't know the answer. It is believed that there is no efficient algorithm. We do not know that there is no efficient algorithm. It is possible that there is an efficient algorithm, but we do not know what it is.

If you can solve it, you are a very clever person, and you will be rich.\n$\\begingroup$ \"It is easy to find a graph isomorphism algorithm that is efficient, if the graphs are not too large.\" This is not true.

If you know that the complement of the graph isomorphism problem is NP-complete, you can take the complement of the problem of determining if two graphs are isomorphic, and you will get the problem of determining if two graphs are not isomorphic. The complement of a NP-complete problem is NP-complete, so the problem of determining if two graphs are not isomorphic is NP-complete."

    "output": "What is the graph isolation problem? ://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism#Isomorphism_problem\nWhat is the graph isomorphism problem? The graph isomorphism problem is the algorithmic problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic. An isomorphism of graphs G and H is a bijection between the vertex sets of G and H, f : V(G) → V(H), such that any two vertices u and v of G are adjacent in G if and only if f(u) and f(v) are adjacent in H. This is an equivalence relation: any graph is isomorphic to itself, and if G is isomorphic to H, then H is isomorphic to G. Determining whether two graphs are isomorphic is a problem in NP and in co-NP, and is the canonical example of a problem in the counting class #P."

    "input": "The integer factorization problem essentially seeks to determine if the value of of an input is less than what variable? ",
    "output": "The integer factorization problem essentially seeks to determine if the value of of an input is less than what variable?  The answer is the square root of the input value.  If the input value is a perfect square, the value of the square root will be a whole number.  However, if the input value is not a perfect square, the value of the square root will be an irrational number.  This is the reason why the square root of an input value is used as the boundary to determine if the input value is a prime number or not.\nThe following is a sample code that will determine if the input value is a prime number or not.\nfunction isPrime(input) {\n    var max = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(input));\n    for (var i = 2; i <= max; i++) {\n        if (input % i === 0) {\n            return false; // not prime\n    return true; // prime\nThis function takes a single input value and returns a boolean value.  If the input value is a prime number, the function returns true.  Otherwise, it returns false.\nThe first line of the function calculates the maximum value of the variable i.  The value of i will be used to iterate from 2 to the maximum value.  The maximum value of i is the square root of the input value.  The second line of the function sets the value of i to 2.\nThe third line of the function is a for loop.  The for loop iterates from 2 to the maximum value.  The fourth line of the function checks if the input value is divisible by the value of i.  If the input value is divisible by the value of i, then the function returns false.  If the input value is not divisible by the value of i, then the function checks if the value of i is less than the maximum value.  If the value of i is less than the maximum value, then the function increments the value of i by 1 and repeats the for loop.  If the value of i is equal to the maximum value, then the function returns true.\nThe function isPrime is a very simple function that can be used to determine if an input value is a prime number or not.  However, the function is not very efficient.  The function checks all the possible values of i from 2 to the maximum value.  If the input value is a large number, the function will take a long time to execute.  To make the function more efficient, we can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.\nThe Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm is a very efficient algorithm that can be used to determine if an input value is a prime number or not.  The algorithm works by creating a list of all the numbers from 2 to the maximum value.  Then, the algorithm iterates through the list and marks all the multiples of 2 as composite numbers.  After marking all the multiples of 2 as composite numbers, the algorithm iterates through the list again and marks all the multiples of 3 as composite numbers.  After marking all the multiples of 3 as composite numbers, the algorithm iterates through the list again and marks all the multiples of 5 as composite numbers.  The algorithm continues to iterate through the list and mark all the multiples of the prime numbers as composite numbers until all the numbers in the list are marked as composite numbers.\nThe following is a sample code that implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine if an input value is a prime number or not.\nfunction isPrime(input) {\n    var max = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(input));\n    var composite = [];\n    for (var i = 2; i <= max; i++) {\n        if (composite[i]) {\n        for (var j = i * i; j <= max; j += i) {\n            composite[j] = true;\n    return!composite[input];\nThis function takes a single input value and returns a boolean value.  If the input value is a prime number, the function returns true.  Otherwise, it returns false.\nThe first line of the function calculates the maximum value of the variable i.  The value of i will be used to iterate from 2 to the maximum value.  The second line of the function creates an empty array called composite.  The third line of the function sets the value of i to 2.\nThe fourth line of the function is a for loop.  The for loop iterates from 2 to the maximum value.  The fifth line of the function checks if the composite array contains the value of i.  If the composite array contains the value of i, then the function marks the value of i as composite.  If the composite array does not contain the value of i, then the function continues to the next line.\nThe sixth line of the function is a for loop.  The for loop iterates from the square of the value of i to the maximum value.  The seventh line of the function checks if the composite array contains the value of j.  If the composite array contains the value of j, then the function marks the value of j as composite.  If the composite array does not contain the value of j, then the function continues to the next line.\nThe eighth line of the function checks if the input value is not in the composite array.  If the input value is not in the composite array, then the function returns true.  Otherwise, the function returns false.\nThe function isPrime is a very efficient function that can be used to determine if an input value is a prime number or not.  The function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine if an input value is a prime number or not.  The function is more efficient than the previous function because it only checks the multiples of the prime numbers."

But if I understand correctly, you want to know how to find the number of ways to do something, when you are given the answer is either yes or no. If that is the case, you can't, because the number of ways to do something can be different in yes and no. For example, you can't find the number of ways to do something if it's either true or false. It's either true or false, and you can't find the number of ways to do something when it's true or false."

P is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time. co-NP is the set of decision problems that have solutions that can be verified in polynomial time. This is the complement of NP, the set of decision problems where the \"no\" answer can be verified in polynomial time.\nThe relationship between P and co-NP is not known.

Please explain. Thank you.\nP and co-NP are disjoint if and only if P is different from NP. This is because if P = NP then co-NP = co-NP.\nLet's assume P = NP, then the problem is reduced to prove that co-NP = NP.\nco-NP = NP is equivalent to NP = co-NP.\nThis is true because of the following:\nco-NP = { L | L is a language and there is a polynomial time algorithm that can verify that a string is not in L}\nNP = { L | L is a language and there is a polynomial time algorithm that can verify that a string is in L}\nFor any L, if it is in co-NP, then it is in NP. The same argument is true for NP.\nIf P = NP, then P = co-NP, and therefore P = NP = co-NP."

    "output": "When would a program not be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress? I am not sure if I understand the question correctly, but I think the problem of finding the maximum clique in a graph is a good example. The maximum clique problem is NP-complete, and hence we cannot hope to find a polynomial time algorithm that solves it for all instances. However, there are efficient algorithms for the problem for instances where the size of the maximum clique is bounded by a constant. These algorithms are based on a greedy algorithm, where we start with the empty set and at each step add a vertex that increases the size of the clique the most. The running time of these algorithms is polynomial in the number of vertices in the graph, but exponential in the size of the maximum clique. So, for instance, if we know that the maximum clique in the graph is at most 10, then we can find the maximum clique in the graph in polynomial time."

    "input": "What algorithm is always practical?",
    "output": "What algorithm is always practical?://practical. I.e. there is no known practical algorithm for the halting problem, and it is known that the halting problem is undecidable. This is one of the few cases in which it is known that a problem is not computable, and is the most widely known example of the general case.\nIs there a practical algorithm that can solve any problem?\nThere are practical algorithms that can solve any problem. In fact, there are practical algorithms that can solve any problem in the world. These algorithms are called “general-purpose” or “universal” algorithms. They are used for a variety of purposes, such as solving mathematical equations, performing scientific calculations, and even running computer programs.\nThe most common example of a universal algorithm is the “general-purpose computer” (GPP). The GPP is a machine that can perform any computation, including any number of steps, with any number of bits. It is the most powerful computer ever created, and it is the most widely used computer in the world.\nIn the real world, there are many examples of universal algorithms. For example, a computer can be programmed to perform any operation, such as addition or subtraction, using any number of steps. This is called “general-purpose computation.” A computer can also be programmed to perform any operation, such as addition or subtraction, using any number of bits. This is called “general-purpose computation.” A computer can also be programmed to perform any operation, such as addition or subtraction, using any number of bits. This is called “general-purpose computation.”\nThe general-purpose computer is used in a wide variety of applications, from performing calculations to running computer programs.

It is a generalization of the subset sum problem to multiple items, in which is the weight limit. It is one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems.\nThe knapsack problem is a decision problem, and is not the same as the knapsack problem, which is an optimization problem.

He was a genius who had a big influence on the development of computers. In the early 1930s he proposed a thought experiment to prove that it is possible for a computer to think. His experiment was published in 1950 and became known as the Turing test. The test is not a test of the computer’s intelligence but of the ability to think. Turing’s test has been used to prove that computers can think. Turing was a genius, but he was not a good mathematician. Turing was a genius who could not solve the problems of mathematics.

The test was invented by Alan Turing in 1950 and is now widely used as an example of how to assess the ability of a machine to think. In the test, a human judge engages in a natural language conversation with one of two agents: a human and a machine. The judge does not know whether they are communicating with a person or a machine. The goal of the test is to determine the machine's ability to show intelligence. The test is based on the Turing Machine, a theoretical machine that is used to compute, and is named after Alan Turing.\nThe Turing test was developed by Alan Turing in 1950. In 1950, Alan Turing published a paper in the journal Mind titled \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence.\" In this paper, Turing proposed the Turing test as a way to test a machine's ability to think. The test is now widely used as an example of how to assess the ability of a machine to think.\nThe Turing test was created as a way to determine whether a machine could be said to think. Turing's idea was that if a machine could convince a human that it was human, then it was thinking.

The paper does not introduce the notion of a complexity class, it's about the notion of a class of problems.\nThe authors define a class of problems as a set of languages, and a complexity class as a set of functions. For example, the class of problems in $P$ is the set of all languages $L$ for which there is a Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p$ such that $x \\in L$ if and only if $M$ accepts $x$ in time $p(|x|)$. The complexity class $P$ is the set of functions $f$ such that there is a Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p$ such that $f(x) = |M(x)|$ and $|M(x)| \\leq p(|x|)$.\nThe authors define a simple measurement to be a function from strings to strings, and a measurement to be a function from strings to strings and a set of strings. A measurement is simple if it is a simple measurement.\nThe authors then define a class of problems as a set of languages $C$ such that there is a measurement $m$ such that for every language $L \\in C$, $L = \\{ x : m(x) \\in L \\}$.\nThe authors then show that any class of problems is closed under polynomial-time Turing reductions if and only if it is closed under a certain kind of measurement. In particular, the authors define a class of problems to be closed under a certain kind of measurement if for any two languages $L_1, L_2 \\in C$ and any measurement $m$, if $L_1 = \\{ x : m(x) \\in L_2 \\}$ then $L_2 \\in C$.\n$\\begingroup$ So, if I understand correctly, the measurement of a language is the language of the measurement? $\\endgroup$ –  user Nov 1 '16 at 7:51\n$\\begingroup$ I'm not sure what you mean.

    "output": "What book featured 25 diverse comninatorial and graph theoretical problems each famous for its computational intractability?://mathoverflow.net/questions/1...\nThis question is about the 1991 book The Discrete Mathematics and its Applications by Kenneth H. Rosen, which contains a section on 25 famous NP-complete problems. The book is still in print and widely used in the classroom, so it is still relevant today. I have two questions about this book.\n  1. Are there any other books that have a similar section?\n  2. Can we find a book that contains a section of famous NP-hard problems?\n$\\begingroup$ You might want to have a look at the questions here: mathoverflow.net/questions/128/… $\\endgroup$ –  Suresh Venkat Mar 8 '14 at 0:28\n$\\begingroup$ Thanks. I had seen that question, but it was not very helpful. I am looking for a book that has a section on famous NP-complete problems, not a book that has one famous NP-complete problem. $\\endgroup$ –  0x2a6d626f Mar 8 '14 at 0:32\n$\\begingroup$ I'm not sure I understand the question. The book you mention has a section with 25 famous NP-complete problems. If you want a book with a section with more than 25 famous NP-complete problems, I'm not sure what you're looking for. If you want a book with a section with a different set of 25 famous NP-complete problems, I'm not sure what you're looking for. If you want a book with a section with 25 different problems, some of which are NP-complete, I'm not sure what you're looking for. If you want a book with a section with 25 NP-complete problems, some of which are famous, I'm not sure what... $\\endgroup$ –  Timothy Chow Mar 8 '14 at 2:20\n$\\begingroup$ I am looking for a book that has a section on famous NP-complete problems. $\\endgroup$ –  0x2a6d626f Mar 8 '14 at 2:23\n$\\begingroup$ I don't know any books that have a section on famous NP-complete problems. $\\endgroup$ –  Timothy Chow Mar 8 '14 at 2:24\nThe section of Rosen's book that you mention is a list of 25 problems that are NP-complete, but it's not a list of the 25 most famous NP-complete problems. There are many other NP-complete problems that are more famous, and I don't think any of them are in that list.\nFor example, the Cook–Levin theorem is the most famous NP-completeness result, and it's not in Rosen's book. The most famous NP-complete problem is probably 3SAT, and it's not in Rosen's book. The most famous NP-complete problem in computer science is probably the clique problem, and it's not in Rosen's book. The most famous NP-complete problem in graph theory is probably the Hamiltonian path problem, and it's not in Rosen's book.\nThe most famous NP-complete problem in number theory is probably the subset sum problem, and it's not in Rosen's book. The most famous NP-complete problem in combinatorics is probably the knapsack problem, and it's not in Rosen's book. The most famous NP-complete problem in computer science education is probably the graph isomorphism problem, and it's not in Rosen's book.\n$\\begingroup$ In the section of Rosen's book that you mention, the problems are not presented in any order. They are just listed in the order in which they are introduced in the book. $\\endgroup$ –  Timothy Chow Mar 8 '14 at 2:33\n$\\begingroup$ I am not sure if the 25 problems in the book are the most famous NP-complete problems.

If the basket is more expensive, we are in a period of inflation. If the basket is less expensive, we are in a period of deflation. If the basket is the same, we are in a period of stability.\nThe consumer price index is released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a part of the Department of Labor. The CPI is used to determine the rate of inflation, which is the rate of change in the cost of the basket of goods and services. The CPI is a measure of the cost of living, which is a measure of how much money is needed to buy the goods and services in the basket.

    "output": "Where is Los Angeles a district of?:// Los Angeles is a city in the state of California, United States.\nLos Angeles is the largest city in California and the second largest in the United States, with a population of nearly four million. It is the county seat of Los Angeles County, although most of it is incorporated as individual cities and is the central city of the Greater Los Angeles Area. It is the main contributor to the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana metropolitan statistical area, which is the United States' second largest with a population of nearly 13 million people. Los Angeles is known for its traffic and urban sprawl.\nLos Angeles was founded on September 4, 1781, by 44 settlers who built a mission named for Saint Louis of France. The city was later known by the Spanish name, Los Angeles, which means \"The City of the Angels\". The city was the capital of Alta California under both Spanish and Mexican rule. The area was ceded to the United States in 1848 after the Mexican-American War. Los Angeles was incorporated as a city on April 4, 1850, at which time it was much smaller than the city that exists today. It was the first city to be incorporated in the state of California. The city's population was only 1,694 in 1850.\nLos Angeles is located on the west coast of the United States. The city is located in the central region of the Los Angeles Basin, a coastal basin that is bounded by the Santa Monica Mountains, San Gabriel Mountains and Santa Ana Mountains. The city is bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west and southwest, Santa Monica Bay on the west, the San Gabriel River and the city of Azusa on the north, the San Fernando Valley on the north, the city of Glendale and the Verdugo Mountains on the north-east, the city of Vernon on the east, the city of Maywood and the city of Huntington Park on the east-southeast, the city of Cudahy, the city of Bell, the city of Maywood and the unincorporated community of Florence-Graham on the south, and the city of South Gate on the south.\nLos Angeles has a Mediterranean climate. Los Angeles is the only major city in the United States to have a Mediterranean climate. The average temperature is 21.7 °C (71.1 °F). The record high was 42.4 °C (108.3 °F) and the record low was -2.2 °C (28.0 °F). Los Angeles receives 382 millimeters (15.0 in) of precipitation per year.\nThe economy of Los Angeles is very diverse. The city is a major center of the entertainment industry, with Hollywood, a district of the city, being the capital of the American film industry. It is the second largest city in the United States by the number of Fortune 500 companies, with 39. Los Angeles is the most populous city in the United States with 3,792,621 people, and the second largest city in the United States by land area with 1,302.41 square kilometers (502.48 sq mi).\nLos

    "output": "What does CDB stand for?://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs395/en/). The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge and attitude of the general public towards the use of CDB in the management of malaria. A cross-sectional study was conducted in the three main cities of Benin (Cotonou, Porto-Novo and Parakou) from March to May 2011. The sample size was calculated using the formula for a cross-sectional study with the following parameters: 95% confidence interval, 5% precision, 50% prevalence and a design effect of 1.5. A total of 1,200 individuals were interviewed. The questionnaire was developed by the investigators and contained questions on knowledge of malaria, attitude towards CDB use, and socio-demographic data. Data were analysed using SPSS software version 17.0.\n## Results\nThe study included 1,200 respondents. The majority of the participants were male (51.2%), aged between 20 and 39 years (53.8%), and had a primary education (65.8%). The majority of respondents had a favourable opinion towards the use of CDB in the management of malaria (84.8%). The factors associated with favourable opinion towards the use of CDB were a higher level of education, higher income, and a positive opinion of CDB. In contrast, a negative opinion of CDB was associated with a lower level of education, a lower income, and a negative opinion of CDB. The majority of respondents were aware that CDB can be used in the management of malaria (73.3%). The factors associated with awareness of the use of CDB were a higher level of education, a higher income, and a favourable opinion of CDB. In contrast, a lower level of education, a lower income, and a negative opinion of CDB were associated with a lack of awareness of the use of CDB.\n## Conclusions\nThis study showed that the general population has a positive attitude towards CDB use in the management of malaria, and that this attitude is influenced by the level of education and the income of the individual.\n## Background\nMalaria is the most important parasitic disease in the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), malaria is responsible for 40% of all infectious disease-related deaths in Africa, and 20% of all deaths in children under 5 years of age [1]. It is estimated that 3.3 billion people are at risk of malaria, and that 1.5 billion people are exposed to infection each year [2]. In 2010, there were an estimated 216 million cases of malaria worldwide, with 655,000 deaths [3]. Malaria is responsible for 20% of all hospital admissions and 25% of all deaths in children under 5 years of age in Benin [4]. In 2010, the country had 2.4 million cases of malaria, with 2.8 million cases in 2009 [5]. The main vectors of malaria in Benin are _Anopheles gambiae_ and _Anopheles funestus_[6].\nIn 2005, the WHO recommended the use of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria [7]. This recommendation was based on the fact that resistance to chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) was reported in the majority of African countries, including Benin [8-10]. In 2007, the WHO recommended the use of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Benin [11]. In 2009, the WHO recommended the use of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) as first-line treatment of uncomplicated malaria in the countries of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) [12]. In 2010, the WHO recommended the use of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) as the first-line treatment of uncomplicated malaria in the countries of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) [13].

    "output": "How much did Sky bid to lose the 4 broadcast packages?://\nSky has been in the news recently for a number of reasons, none of which have been good. The first, and most obvious, is the launch of NOW TV, which has been a great success, and is a threat to the business model of the current pay TV providers, Sky and Virgin Media. The second is the decision by BSkyB to pull the plug on its subscription services in the Netherlands and Germany, which will result in the loss of around 1.3m subscribers. The third is the fact that Sky is not bidding for the 4 UK broadcast packages.\nThe UK government is currently reviewing the way in which the BBC and ITV are funded, and the government has said that it wants to see more competition in the market. The government has also said that it wants to see the BBC and ITV spend more on content and less on administration. The government is considering allowing the BBC and ITV to bid for the 4 UK broadcast packages, which would allow the BBC and ITV to bid for the same packages.\nThis is a very important issue for the BBC and ITV.

This meant that Sky had to offer these channels to its competitors, which included Virgin Media and BT. The new channels were also made available to all other pay-TV providers.\nThe CC’s report is a timely reminder that the European Commission’s (EC) recent decision to allow Sky to buy Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia was based on a number of conditions, one of which was that Sky must offer its new channels to its competitors.\nThe EC’s decision is currently being challenged by the European Court of Justice. If the decision is upheld, it will be interesting to see whether the EC applies the same conditions to Sky’s acquisition of Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia.\nThe CC’s report also highlights the importance of ensuring that competition is maintained in the pay-TV market. This is particularly important given the increasing importance of pay-TV in the UK, with more and more people subscribing to pay-TV services.\nThe CC’s report is a valuable reminder that competition is a key factor in ensuring that consumers have access to a wide range of channels and that prices remain competitive.\nThe CC’s report is a valuable reminder that competition is a key factor in ensuring that consumers have access to a wide range of channels and that prices remain competitive."

He was dismissed after a disciplinary hearing, but the Employment Appeal Tribunal later ruled that he had been wrongly dismissed. It found that the alleged victim had been \"unreliable, untruthful and inconsistent\" in her evidence.\nBSkyB had argued that Mr Loughran should have told his managers that he had been previously been disciplined for sexual harassment by a previous employer.\nThe Court of Appeal said that the tribunal had been entitled to conclude that it was not reasonable to expect Mr Loughran to reveal details of his private life. Lord Justice Buxton, sitting with Lord Justice Maurice and Lord Justice Sedley, said: \"We are satisfied that the tribunal was entitled to conclude that the claimant was not obliged to disclose his private life, and that the decision to dismiss him was wrong.\""
